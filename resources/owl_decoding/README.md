### Purpose
The knowledge graph can be built with or without the inclusion of edges that contain OWL Semantics. The method we use to decode OWL semantics is called OWL-NETS. 

OWL-NETS (NEtwork Transformation for Statistical learning) is a computational method that reversibly abstracts Web 
Ontology Language (OWL)-encoded biomedical knowledge into a more biologically meaningful network representation. 
OWL-NETS generates semantically rich knowledge graphs that contain heterogeneous nodes and edges and can be used for 
tasks which do not require OWL semantics. For additional information on this method and how it works, please see the 
above **[`Wiki`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/wiki/OWL-NETS-2.0)**.
